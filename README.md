README for the batch adjust warning figures git repository.
----------------------

This project consists of the r-code that produces the figures used in "Methods that remove batch effects while retaining group
differences may lead to exaggerated confidence in downstream analyses", V. Nygaard, E. A.
RÃ¸dland, E. Hovig, manuscript in preparation.

The figures illustrate the side effects from batch effect adjustments using ComBat with study group as covariate or similar methods.

### figurescript.r

Calls the individual figure scripts. The only script needed to be run in order to recreate the figures in the article. Takes about 6 minutes. 

### sessionInfo.txt

The output of sessionInfo() when figurescript was run.

### overviewplot.r

Figure 1. in the manuscript. 

### reanalysis/  

The individual data sets that are used to illustrate the adverse effect of ComBat.
Consist of a figure-script that loads the data, process with or without ComBat, run a significance analysis and creates a plot of the p-values. Figures 2. and 3 in the manuscript.

### tex/

The tex files and related files needed to compile the manuscript as a pdf

### Additional resources

In our work, many more analyses than presented in the above figure-scripts were performed. These are more detailed and go beyond the scope of our article. But for the especially interested some of them are made available as rmarkdown reports here:
